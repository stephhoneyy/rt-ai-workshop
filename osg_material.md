# OSG and Discipleship Support with ChatGPT
This lesson shows how to use ChatGPT to support **OSG preparation and discipleship**.

## Why Use AI for OSG Material?
- Generate discussion questions quickly  
- Summarize passages in plain language  
- Create icebreakers and reflection prompts  
- Adapt material for different groups (youth, young adults, mixed congregation)  
- Suggest prayer points, worship themes, or journaling prompts

👉 Each iteration brings you closer to material that fits your group.  

## Practical Tips  

- ✅ Be clear about **audience**: “youth group,” “young adults,” “mixed congregation,” etc.  
- ✅ Keep prompts **specific**: mention the passage, number of questions, and type of questions.  
- ✅ Use refinement: ask for “simpler,” “more reflective,” “shorter,” etc.  
- ✅ Always **review and adapt**: AI drafts are a starting point, not the final word.  

## Ministry Reminder 🙏  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ChatGPT can generate outlines, questions, and summaries — but it cannot discern the needs of your group.  
> Use it as a helper, and always apply pastoral care, prayer, and biblical discernment before teaching.  

> **“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.”**
