# OSG and Discipleship Support with ChatGPT
This lesson shows how to use ChatGPT to support **OSG preparation and discipleship**.  

> [!WARNING]  
> AI cannot replace prayer, study, or discernment — but it can be a **helpful tool** to spark ideas, save time, and create materials you can refine for your group.

## Why Use AI for OSG Material?
- Generate discussion questions quickly  
- Summarize passages in plain language  
- Create icebreakers and reflection prompts  
- Adapt material for different groups (youth, young adults, mixed congregation)  
- Suggest prayer points, worship themes, or journaling prompts

We will be going through the same workflow as before: **ADD PROMPT --> REFINE --> ITERATE**

## Step 1 — Introduce a Simple Prompt 
Once again, let's introduce a simple prompt to ChatGPT:
```
Summarize John 1 in simple words.
Then create 5 open-ended discussion questions for a young adults Bible study group.
Include 1 opening question and 1 closing question.
```

---

Sample Output:

> [!NOTE]  
> Your output may look a little different from the example shown here.  
> That’s normal — ChatGPT doesn’t always give identical answers.  
> The important thing is that the **rules are followed** and you can always refine it to make adjustments.

Here’s a simple breakdown of John 1 and some discussion prompts for your young adults Bible study:

# 📖 John 1 Summary (in simple words)

In the beginning, Jesus (the Word) already existed. He was with God, and He was God.

Everything was made through Him, and life and light come from Him.

John the Baptist was sent by God to prepare people to meet Jesus, the true Light.

Many people did not recognize or accept Jesus, but those who did were given the right to become children of God.

Jesus became human and lived among us. He showed us God’s glory, full of love and truth.

John the Baptist testified that Jesus is greater than him and is the Lamb of God.

Jesus began calling His first disciples, who followed Him and shared the good news with others.

# 🗣 Discussion Questions

## Opening Question:

What’s something you’ve “missed” in life because you didn’t recognize it at first (an opportunity, a person’s kindness, a blessing)? How might that connect to people not recognizing Jesus when He came?

Main Questions:
1. John describes Jesus as both the “Word” and the “Light.” What do these images mean to you, and how do they shape your view of who Jesus is?
2. Verse 12 says those who receive Jesus become “children of God.” What does that identity mean for you personally in your daily life?
3. John the Baptist points people away from himself and toward Jesus. What might it look like for us to “point others to Jesus” in our own context today?
4. The first disciples immediately invited others to “come and see” Jesus. How can we invite others to “come and see” in ways that feel natural and authentic?

## Closing Question:
1. After reading John 1, what’s one thing you want to do differently this week to live more in the light of Jesus?

Do you want me to also make leader’s notes/possible directions for each question, in case your group gets stuck?

## Step 2 - Refine the Output
Look at the draft and ask yourself:  
- Are the questions open-ended or too factual?  
- Do they fit my group’s age and background?  
- Is the summary too long or too short?

You can refine it by asking:
```
“Adapt the questions for a small group of adults who are new to the Bible.”

“Reduce the number of questions to 3 for a shorter study.”
```

## Step 3 - Iterate
Keep adjusting until you’re happy with the results!

Your refining questions can cover a whole range of areas, such as, but not limited to:
- Adjusting audience
- Adjusting time
- Structuring materials
- Suggesting supporting verses  

👉 Each iteration brings you closer to material that fits your group.

## A Note for Using AI for this Area
While AI can be a helpful tool, it's really important to not be too over-reliant on it. I believe that tools like ChatGPT should not be used as a replacement for what you do but more as an aide.  

I personally like to use it **AFTER** I have finished a somewhat first draft of my materials. I use it to help structure my materials and recommend good verses to support my points.  

As with all things, the best way to study the Bible and grow is to do it yourself. Manually write out your material, look for verses, analyse them with references to commentaries. If you ever get stuck at a small obstacle, you can use AI to help out.  

If you ask ChatGPT to provide references, always cross-check them yourself, since AI can sometimes generate mistakes or misattributions. Think of it as a conversation partner that offers drafts and ideas, but where the final responsibility remains with you as a leader.  

## Practical Tips  

- ✅ Be clear about **audience**: “youth group,” “young adults,” “mixed congregation,” etc.  
- ✅ Keep prompts **specific**: mention the passage, number of questions, and type of questions.  
- ✅ Use refinement: ask for “simpler,” “more reflective,” “shorter,” etc.  
- ✅ Always **review and adapt**: AI drafts are a starting point, not the final word.  

## Ministry Reminder 🙏  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ChatGPT can generate outlines, questions, and summaries — but it cannot discern the needs of your group.  
> Use it as a helper, and always apply pastoral care, prayer, and biblical discernment before teaching.  

> **“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.”**  
> — James 1:5
