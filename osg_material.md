# OSG and Discipleship Support with ChatGPT
This lesson shows how to use ChatGPT to support **OSG preparation and discipleship**.  
AI cannot replace prayer, study, or discernment — but it can be a **helpful tool** to spark ideas, save time, and create materials you can refine for your group.

## Why Use AI for OSG Material?
- Generate discussion questions quickly  
- Summarize passages in plain language  
- Create icebreakers and reflection prompts  
- Adapt material for different groups (youth, young adults, mixed congregation)  
- Suggest prayer points, worship themes, or journaling prompts

---

We will be going through the same workflow as before: **ADD PROMPT --> REFINE --> ITERATE**

## Step 1 — Introduce a Simple Prompt 

## Step 2 - Refine the Output

## Step 3 - Iterate
Keep adjusting until you’re happy with the results!

---

- warn about over reliance on AI
- the best way to learn is to do it yourself
- ask chatgpt to provide references --> crosscheck yourself

👉 Each iteration brings you closer to material that fits your group.  

## Practical Tips  

- ✅ Be clear about **audience**: “youth group,” “young adults,” “mixed congregation,” etc.  
- ✅ Keep prompts **specific**: mention the passage, number of questions, and type of questions.  
- ✅ Use refinement: ask for “simpler,” “more reflective,” “shorter,” etc.  
- ✅ Always **review and adapt**: AI drafts are a starting point, not the final word.  

## Ministry Reminder 🙏  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ChatGPT can generate outlines, questions, and summaries — but it cannot discern the needs of your group.  
> Use it as a helper, and always apply pastoral care, prayer, and biblical discernment before teaching.  

> **“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him.”**  
> — James 1:5
