# Introduction to Prompting

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt is simply what you type into ChatGPT — like asking a question or giving instructions.

Example:  
> "Create an usher roster for September with A, B, and C."

## The Prompt Process
1. **Introduce** → Ask ChatGPT to do something.  
2. **Refine** → See what needs improvement and ask again.  
3. **Iterate** → Keep adjusting until it looks right.

Think of it like working with an assistant — you give feedback, they try again.

## Tips for Good Prompts
- ✅ Be clear and specific  
- ✅ Give context (who, what, when)  
- ✅ Use plain language  
- ✅ Don’t expect perfection the first time

## A Gentle Reminder
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> AI is a helper. You are still the leader and decision-maker.  
> Always review outputs carefully before using them in ministry.
