> — Proverbs 16:9

## Overview
This repository contains demo materials for a short workshop on how to use ChatGPT to assist with common tasks in church life. The goal is to show that AI is not here to replace people, but to support ministry teams by saving time on admin and helping generate creative, adaptable resources.

> [!WARNING]  
> ChatGPT is a tool — it can draft and support, but spiritual discernment and final teaching always rests with the user.
> Always review, edit, and pray over any material before using it in ministry.
